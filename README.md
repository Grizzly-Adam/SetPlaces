Minetest Game mod: SetPlaces
==========================
By Grizzly Adam
Based on original code by sfan5

Allows you to set shortcuts to places, like the default /sethome. Included are all the ones that we use on my server, feel free to modify to fit your needs.

Included:
setbowl
setcoffee
setjobsite
setmine
setspouse
setvacation
setwork

Example: 
	/setbowl sets a location as bowl (i.e. my bowling alley)
	/bowl takes me to the location that I set.

See license.txt for license information.
